# TerraLunar-tkbench.py

"TerraLunar-tkbench.py" is a simplified more portable version of my earlier program "TerraLunar.py". The -tkbench version is primarily intended to explore the performance of the Python "tkinter" portable windowing interface on a variety of computing platforms (MacOS, Windows, and Linux).

Unrestricted. This is primarily for learning Python and computing.
